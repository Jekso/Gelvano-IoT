- LAMP Stack ( i use PHP for back end ) .
- Chart.js To draw Charts as Values over time for Factory Machines readings .

# Comming Soon
- I will add more features like (voltages , amperes , pH and pressure) readings .
- I will make the android app using Java .
- I will repeat that project using Raspberry Pi .
- I will simplify and optimize PHP code .
